 *
 * Browsers do not understand JSX out of the box, so most React users rely on a compiler like Babel or TypeScript to
 * transform JSX code into regular JavaScript. Many preconfigured toolkits like Create React App include a JSX
 * transform under the hood.
 *
 * The old JSX transform turned JSX into React.createElement(...) calls, i.e. React was needed to be in scope if you
 * used JSX. React 17 release offers a new, rewritten version of the JSX transform, which introduces new entry points
 * to the React package that are intended to only be used by compilers like Babel and TypeScript. Instead of
 * transforming JSX to React.createElement, the new JSX transform automatically imports special functions from those
 * new entry points in the React package and calls them.
 *
 * This allows you to use JSX without importing React (i.e. does not require React to be in scope). You would still
 * need to import React in order to use Hooks or other exports that React provides. It is also recommended to:
 * 	- remove all unused React imports as a result of the new JSX transform upgrade
 * 	- change all existing namespace imports (i.e. import * as React) and default React imports (i.e import React) to
 * 		destructured named imports (i.e. import { useState })
 *
 * @see {@link https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#whats-a-jsx-transform}
 * for further information.

 * When you set target to _blank with Links, it is recommended to always set rel attribute to noopener and/or
 * noreferrer while linking to third party content, such that:
 * 	- noopener prevents the new page from being able to access the window.opener property and ensures it runs in a
 * 		separate process. Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.
 * 	- noreferrer has the same effect, but also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page (removing
 * 		the referrer header will affect analytics though)

 * There are a few stylistic rules to display a copyright message on your website:
 * 	- use Copyright or Â©, but you need not use both
 * 	- there is no period between the date and the organization/person who claims the copyright
 * 	- if your website contains material that was created in previous years, you may want to opt to use a date range in
 *		the copyright notice
 *	- e.g. Copyright 2005-2021 SiteCare, LLC

 *
 * Date() constructor returns a Date object representing current date and time (as of the time of instantiation) when
 * no parameters are provided. Parameters for the Date() constructor include:
 * 	- timestamp number: an integer value representing the timestamp, which is the number of milliseconds since midnight
 * 	  at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC (aka the epoch)
 * 	- date string: a string value representing a date, which comes in different formats:
 * 			- date time string format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ (standardized and will work reliably). See
 * 				[date time string format]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#date_time_string_format}
 * 				for caveats on using different formats.
 * 			- short date format: MM/DD/YYYY
 * 			- long date format: MMM DD YYYY or DD MMM YYYY or MMMM DD, YYYY HH:mm:ss (may not work in all runtimes)
 * 	- date object: an existing Date object to copy from, with the same date and time
 * 	- individual date and time components: year, month, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond parameters. Any
 * 		missing fields are given the lowest possible value (1 for day and 0 for every other component).
 *

 *
 * UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) is the primary time standard globally used to regulate clocks and time. It
 * establishes a reference for the current time, forming the basis for civil time and time zones. UTC facilitates
 * international communication, navigation, scientific research, and commerce. Time zones around the world are
 * expressed using positive or negative offsets from UTC (as in the list of time zones by UTC offset). UTC is the same
 * as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). When setting or getting a date, without specifying the time zone, JavaScript will use
 * the browser's time zone.
